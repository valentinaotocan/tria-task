# Introduction
This is a web application that rolls numbers from 1 to 20, from the random.org intigers API endpoint.

The design of the application was created by me.

## Technologies

## Features
- Roll random number - fetches a number from the API and adds it to the numbers list, or increases the appearence by one if the number was already fetched.
- Reduce and delete appearances - there are two buttons, first reduces a number's appearance by one, and the second button removes the number from the list.
- Statistics - offers insight on the rolled numbers with the following stats: total number of rolled numbers, total number of appearances of all numbers, sum of all numbers and smallest and biggest number.
- Clear option - a button that clears clears the entire list.
